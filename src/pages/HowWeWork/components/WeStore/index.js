        The Storage of purchased raw materials is key to the Bahranda strategy aimed at providing
value for dealers. Due to Nigeriaâ€™s seasonal approach to Farming, prices tend to increase as we
move away from the harvest season. Therefore, timely storage helps to accrue value to the
dealer due to price increases while Bahranda measures the Manufacturers needs in terms of
Price Point at every demand cycle.
